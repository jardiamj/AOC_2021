# Advent Of Code 2021

This repository contains the solution to the 2021 Advent Of Code puzzles.

I started solving them with Python but then I switched to C++ on day 5.

The code here is not fully documented since I started late and have been trying
to catch up. I will clean it up and document it as time permits.

It is public in case anyone can benefit from it but I recommend you try to
solve the puzzles on your own before you look at any of these answers here.
